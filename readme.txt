loader.py
The script is designed for downloading Instagram posts from multiple users using the Instaloader library. It reads a list of usernames from a CSV file, downloads the most recent 50 posts for each user (including images and videos), and logs the download details into a Google Sheet. The script handles Google Sheets authentication via a service account JSON file and provides functions to manage directories and log activities. The flow is interactive, asking for user confirmation on usernames and scraping time intervals, then executing the downloads sequentially with randomized pauses between each account to simulate human-like behavior. It also includes error handling for rate-limiting and exceptions during scraping.

To improve the script, various enhancements could be made. The code could be modularized further to separate concerns like authentication, downloading, and logging, making it more maintainable. Error handling can be expanded to include specific cases such as network errors, invalid usernames, or permission issues with Google Sheets. Instead of pausing randomly, the use of an exponential backoff strategy could be implemented to better handle rate limits. Additionally, implementing multi-threading or async functionality could significantly speed up the scraping process, as it currently processes each user sequentially. The logging system could be refined by introducing a more structured format (e.g., JSON logs) and integrating alerts for critical failures.


loadernog.py
This script is very similar to the previous one but without the Google Sheets integration. It reads Instagram usernames from a CSV file, downloads the most recent 50 posts (including images and videos) for each user using the Instaloader library, and logs the download details into a local CSV file. The script includes interactive user prompts for confirmation of the usernames and the sleep intervals to wait between each scrape. It uses the logging library to log activities and errors and handles graceful termination through a custom signal handler. The flow is sequential, where each user is processed one-by-one with random sleep intervals in between to reduce the chances of being rate-limited by Instagram.

To improve this script, the main focus would be to optimize performance and reliability. Implementing asynchronous scraping with the asyncio library or using concurrent processing could drastically reduce the time required to scrape multiple users. This would be especially useful for scenarios where the number of usernames is large. The error handling could be extended to catch more specific exceptions like network issues or authentication failures. Furthermore, a retry mechanism with exponential backoff could be introduced to handle rate-limits more effectively. The logging could also be enhanced by integrating with external monitoring tools to keep track of errors and activity in real-time without checking log files manually.


test-video.py
This script focuses on downloading only video posts from specified Instagram usernames using the Instaloader library. It reads usernames from a CSV file and logs the download details (username, shortcode, file path, timestamp) into a local CSV file. Similar to previous scripts, it includes features like random sleep intervals between downloads to mimic human-like behavior, interactive user prompts for confirmation, and a countdown timer for waiting between scrapes. The script also handles graceful shutdown through a custom signal handler and extensive logging for debugging purposes. The key difference here is that it filters and downloads only video posts, excluding other post types such as images or carousel posts.

To make the script better, adding support for parallel processing or asynchronous handling would significantly improve efficiency, especially if the number of usernames to process is large. Introducing more specific error handling and retry logic for network or authentication issues would also increase robustness. Furthermore, the script could benefit from additional features like resuming from where it left off if interrupted, filtering videos based on metadata (e.g., date or views), or providing an option to download specific types of videos. Lastly, integrating a real-time dashboard or report generation for monitoring download progress and statistics would enhance usability, especially for large-scale scraping operations.


selenium.py
This script automates the process of downloading posts from both Instagram and Facebook based on a list of URLs provided in an Excel file. It uses Instaloader to handle Instagram posts, and there's a placeholder for implementing Facebook post scraping logic. The script reads URLs from an input Excel file, checks the URL to determine the platform, and downloads either images or videos from Instagram. The script can handle logging in with credentials or session cookies, and it stores the scraped content in designated folders for each platform. After downloading, it logs the URL, image path, video path, and caption to an output Excel file. The script is set up to support multiple platforms, though currently only Instagram scraping is implemented.

The script can be enhanced by implementing Facebook scraping logic using libraries like Selenium or requests for handling web scraping. Adding support for more platforms would increase its versatility. Improving session management to handle session expiration and login failures more gracefully would make it more robust. Incorporating multi-threading or parallel processing would speed up processing, especially when handling a large number of URLs. Including a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier input of credentials, file paths, and other configurations would make it more user-friendly. Error handling can also be improved, such as providing detailed logs and alerts for failed downloads or unexpected issues.


playwr.py
This script automates the process of downloading Instagram videos using Playwright, without requiring a login. It reads a list of Instagram usernames from a CSV file, navigates to each user's profile page, scrolls to load posts, and extracts video URLs directly from the page using Playwright's sync_api. If a video is found, it is downloaded using the requests library and saved locally. The downloaded video details (username, shortcode, file path, and timestamp) are then logged into a CSV file. The script is designed to run the Playwright browser in a non-headless mode (i.e., with the browser window visible) to handle interactions more effectively.

To improve this script, several changes can be made. Implementing headless mode in Playwright would make the script run faster and use less memory. The current scrolling logic can be optimized to ensure that all posts are loaded before extraction, as Instagram's dynamic loading mechanism may miss posts if the scroll intervals are not sufficient. The extraction and download processes could be parallelized using concurrent or async techniques to reduce overall execution time. Additionally, better handling of different types of Instagram content, like carousels or IGTV, would increase its utility. Improving error handling to catch more exceptions and retry mechanisms for failed downloads would also enhance its robustness. Lastly, adding proxy support or randomized user agents could help mitigate scraping blocks and rate limits imposed by Instagram.
